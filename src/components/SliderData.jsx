        description:"Tightly stretched tensile fibres are knitted inside a pressurised Nike Air unit, giving the Zoom Air cushioning its snappy responsiveness. Each time an athlete's foot touches down, the fibres compress to cushion the impact before quickly springing back to their original state, generating an explosive, powerful response off the ground. Whether elite athletes are racing or training, they look to Zoom Air for a fast, responsive ride and that snappy, quick-off-the-ground feel that helps optimise their quest for speed."   ,
